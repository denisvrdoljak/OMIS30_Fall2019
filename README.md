# OMIS 30: Intro to Programming

Hi! Welcome to the GitHub repository for OMIS 30: Intro to Programming. Here, you will find useful resources throughout the quarter.


## Getting Started

To get set up quickly, [install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). This will include everything you need to get up and running -- Python, Spyder (a Python IDE), and Jupyter Notebooks! You can find the installation guide [here](https://github.com/denisvrdoljak/OMIS30_Fall2018/blob/master/AnacondaInstallation.pdf).
**Make sure you install Python 3.x!**
