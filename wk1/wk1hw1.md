# OMIS 30: Week 1, HW 1



## Getting Started

Set up your machine by [installing Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). This will include everything you need to get up and running -- Python, Spyder (a Python IDE), and Jupyter Notebooks! You can find the installation guide [here](https://github.com/denisvrdoljak/OMIS30_Fall2018/blob/master/AnacondaInstallation.pdf).
**Make sure you install Python 3.x!**
