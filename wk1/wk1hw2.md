# OMIS 30: Week 1, HW 2



## Hello World, Hello You

### Hello World
Hello World is a common first program in programming. The point is to write a program that says "Hello World" via the standard output. In Python, it's actually pretty simple; it's only 1 line long! So, we're going to mix things up and challenge you to do that and a little more.
* Write and run Hello World from the command line
- We did this in class. 
* Write and run Hello World in a Jupyter Notebook (Take a look at the notebook in the helloworld folder.)
- Include this (the hello world part, not the entire sample notebook), add the second part (Hello You, below), and submit in the same notebook. (Email to instructor.) 

### Hello You
* Modify your Hello World program in your Jupyter Notebook to ask a user for their name, then say hello to them.
- Example:
(program says) What is your name? 
(user enters) John
(program says) Hello John!
### HINT: Google how to combine strings in Python, then take a look at the notebook (in this folder on github) with the examples from class.
- Submit your Jupyter Notebook 

## The Command Line
### Make a stand alone shell script called ‘HW1_2.sh’ that does:
* NOTE: a shell script is just a file with a series of Command Line commands. In Unix/Linux it's called a shell script, and it's name ends in .sh; in Windows/Dos, it's called a Vatch File, and ends with .bat. In both cases, For our purposes, it will be just a series of commands that you would normally run from the command line.
* Make a new folder names OMIS30
* Inside that folder make a new text file README.txt
* Inside the README.txt write the line ‘OMIS30 Intro to Programming (with Python)’
* Make a new folder inside OMIS30 that is named: Assignments
* Copy the README.TXT from the OMIS30 folder to the Assignments Folder (note: copy, not move)
* Name the new file README2.txt (in other words, rename the new file after you copy it)
* Append a text line to the README2.TXT - ‘Assignments Placed Here’
### Submit your shell script (batch file for Windows)


## Email your homework to your instructor (denisvrdoljak at berkeley dot edu).
