# Week 8 Lab


Write a program (standalone Python script, not Jypyter notebook) that gets the missing column names from a file 'headers.txt', then takes data from standard in (which will be missing its column names/header row), and combines the two to create a complete csv with column names/headers.

This program would be run with the following linux command:
cat dataonly.csv | python yourlab8answer.py


Where dataonly.csv is the data (missing headers), and headers.txt is the column names. Note, these are taken from the group.csv example from class, so your final re-constructed file should look just like group.csv.
